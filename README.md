When the Covid19 is severe, I have to pay attention to how many people are diagnosed today. Sometimes it is difficult to find the number of people today in the news, so I want to make this web application so that I can see it when I want to watch it.

Because the time zone of each country is different, and the data collection time is also different, so the number of confirmed cases may be the number of yesterday. Please forgive me.
